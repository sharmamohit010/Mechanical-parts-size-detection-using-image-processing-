# Mechanical Parts Size Detection Using Image Processing

This project uses image processing techniques to detect the size and dimensions of mechanical parts from images. By leveraging computer vision libraries like OpenCV, the project can analyze images of mechanical parts and provide precise measurements such as length, width, diameter, and other dimensions. The application can be useful for automated quality control in manufacturing, reverse engineering, or quick measurements in engineering tasks.

## Features
- **Automatic Size Detection**: Automatically detects and calculates dimensions of mechanical parts in images.
- **Supports Multiple Part Types**: Handles different shapes such as circular, rectangular, and irregular mechanical parts.
- **High Accuracy**: Employs advanced image processing techniques to ensure high accuracy in measurements.
- **Visualization**: Annotates the detected dimensions on the image for visual verification.

## Technologies
- **Python**: Main programming language used.
- **OpenCV**: For image processing and computer vision tasks.
- **NumPy**: To handle array-based operations.
